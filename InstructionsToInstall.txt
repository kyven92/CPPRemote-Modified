Make sure you have boost library installed.

Get CppRemote source code by:
git clone git://github.com/kwanti/CppRemote.git
or download from here.
You can build from the ide project files inside the ide folder.

You can also build the library from command prompt window using cmake.

cd <CppRemote root directory> (There should be a CMakeLists.txt in this directory)
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
Note: If cmake could not find boost library, you need to update the BOOST_ROOT path in the CMakeLists.txt.

When building your application, make sure you link to the libraries below.

remote (this library)
boost.serialization
boost.thread
boost.system
boost.chrono
On Linux, you will need to link to pthread.

On Windows, you will also need to link to ws2_32 and wswsock2.
